    <h1>Bagpipes</h1>
    <p>I make bagpipes using PA12, a type of nylon that is biocompatible and safe for long-term skin contact. My designs are influenced by various 18th and 19th century makers, particularly Robert Reid of North Shields, Jimmy Young of Alnwick, and Malcolm MacGregor of London.
Here is a comparison of the different designs I offer for the same tenor drone: </p>

 <p> Currently, I only offer the following models:
     
        <li> <strong>Scottish Border Pipes in A</strong>: This is the quietest design I have come up with so far, offering the most compatibility with chanter reeds from different makers. The three drones are configured as Bass A, Tenor A, and Alto E.</li>
         <img src="https://z-qiao.github.io/bagpipes/Border_pipes_London.png" alt="Scottish Border Pipes in A" /><br>   

        <li> <strong>Lindsay System Scottish Small-Pipes in A</strong>: This is my personal go-to instrument. It covers a range of over two octaves, from bottom D (one octave lower than the Uilleann pipes) with some chromatic notes in between. The three drones are configured as Bass A, Tenor A, and Alto E.</li>
         <img src="https://z-qiao.github.io/bagpipes/Lindsay_Alnwick.png" alt="Lindsay System Scottish Small-Pipes in A" /><br>

        <li> <strong>Scottish Small-Pipes in C</strong>: This design is based on Colin Ross's work but includes some improvements, such as a minor third (E flat) and sharp leading notes (B natural). The drones are the same as those of the Northumbrian small-pipes, so the chanter can be used as an add-on for the Northumbrian small-pipes. The three drones are configured as Bass C, Baritone F, and Tenor C.</li>
        <li> <strong>Keyless Three-Drone Northumbrian Small-Pipes in F</strong>: The three drones are nominally configured as Big G, Small D, and Small G. Alternatively, four drones can be configured as Big D, Big G, Small D, and Small G.</li>

        <li> <strong>Highland Half-Size or Reel Pipes Chanter in B-flat</strong>: The chanter is based on a Thomas Glen reel pipes chanter, with a minor adjustment to bring it to concert B-flat.</li>

        <li> <strong>Double Scottish Small-Pipes Chanter in D</strong>: There are two options to choose from: offset holes, where the top and bottom hands are rotated inward to make side movement easier, or straight holes. I also offer two configurations for the holes: 7+7 and 7+3. It is possible to add a second thumbhole for the minor third (F natural), but I have not implemented this feature on existing instruments yet.</li>
